# 4100901-final-project
This repository contains the example for the final project of the course computation structures.

## Hardware prerequisites
* The example is a digital lock system featuring an STM32L4 for controling the system, an ESP8266 for interfacing with the internet, a keypad for getting the sequences, and an OLED display for GUI. See more details in the [C4Model](Doc/C4Model.md)
* The following is the pinout of the STM32:

## Firmware prerequisites
* The ESP8266 runs the esp-link [v2.2.3](https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link/releases/tag/v2.2.3) firmware. Please follow the [serial flashing guide](https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link/blob/master/FLASHING.md#initial-serial-flashing).
* The STM32 runs the firmware compiled from this repository using STM32CubeIDE.

## Building and Flashing
* Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
* Compile using the current project settings.
* Use an ST-LINK to flash the firmware into the STM32.

## Functionality
* The keypad...
* The Debug console...
* The internet interface...
* The system sends metrics to the internet every 24h by using an alarm of the embedded RTC.
